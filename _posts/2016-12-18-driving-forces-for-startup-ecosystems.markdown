As I have been travelling around the world trying to understand local innovation ecosystems, one of the most interesting things to uncover has been the driving forces behind the innovation movement in each particular city or country. What was the spark that ignited the entrepreneurial fire and who were the people fanning the flames?

My first stops, South Korea and Russia, shared a similar driver in the government. The governments of both countries have traditionally taken a very hands-on approach in many aspects of society, and the startup ecosystems have been no exception. Each government takes a different approach and has different goals in mind, but in both cases much of the startup funding comes either directly or indirectly from the government and many of the support programs for startups are government-led. For South Korea the key aims are around job creation and reducing reliance on the super-size ‘chaebol’ conglomerates (e.g. Samsung, LG, Hyundai). For Russia it is about diversifying a struggling economy away from over-dependence on oil and gas and other natural resource (along with finding new ways to extend the profitability of these industries). 

If we look at the timelines of each ecosystem, we see that Russia kicked off its grandest project – the Skolkovo Foundation – in 2006, around the time that social media platforms like Facebook were really beginning to make their mark on the world. South Korea’s government-driven initiatives have tended to be more recent, with some key projects like D.Camp in Seoul and the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund launched in 2012. This timing coincides with some of the weakest growth levels for the country following the financial crisis, and with the beginning of a general rise in unemployment rates for young people. 

Moving through to Finland, I was fascinated to discover that this was an ecosystem born and led by the students. University groups at pivotal institutions like Aalto University and University of Helsinki formed entrepreneurial societies which supported education, events and incubation of startups. The annual Slush conference in Helsinki is testament to the success of the student groups – beginning in 2008 as a get together for 200 startups, since the Aalto Entrepreneurship Society took it over in 2011 it has grown to a global event with over 15,000 attendees.

Nokia were also a key player for this ecosystem, initially by raising Finland’s international brand as a technology centre, and later during their downfall by freeing talent back into the ecosystem and giving young people the incentive to carve their own paths rather than relying on cushy corporate jobs. The timeline for the Helsinki movement began around 2008, in line with the growing popularity of the iPhone (and the related decline of Nokia), and interest in entrepreneurship developed rapidly as the financial crisis took hold. 

Heading down to the Baltics, the drivers change again, with Estonia’s thriving ecosystem seeded by the success of startup pioneer Skype, bought by Microsoft in 2011 for $8.5 Billion. This phenomenal exit brought investment funds back into the ecosystem to seed new startups and also freed up talent to begin new ventures (the so-called ‘Skype Mafia’ has spawned more than 30 new companies).

Tracing back the historic roots for the Skype success, one theory points to the Soviet decision to build an Institute of Cybernetics in Estonia, increasing technical expertise in the country at an early stage in digital development. There was also a specific case of a group of teachers having the forethought to bring some disused computers into their schools in the mid 1980s, allowing particular groups of young people the opportunity to get a head-start on tech education (apparently the original Skype techies came from this fortunate group). The Estonia government went on to value technology education with their pioneering ‘Tiger’s Leap’ program in the 1990s, which brought internet connectivity and computer labs to almost all schools across the country. 

Most recently I have been exploring the ecosystem in Riga in Latvia, and here we have a different story once again. The Latvian ecosystem is the youngest and smallest of those I have studied so far. Similar to Estonia, the driver is from the startup community itself, although Latvia is missing large scale exits like the Skype deal, and this means there is minimal funding coming back into the ecosystem and less of an international brand. In this early Latvian ecosystem, it seems that the driving players are a small community with a big heart and a resilient sense of determination. This community is working to build events and co-working spaces, draw in funding and improve international branding, all with fairly minimal active support from the government.

You can’t help but be impressed with the efforts of the community in Riga, and with the genuine sense of comradery and support that exists in this small group. There is a down-to-earth realism as they recognise the challenges they face, and also a strong sense of pride in their young country that helps them dig their heels in and continue through slow growth and stagnant periods without funding. Having spent time with this group I too am hopeful and optimistic that their dogged work will pay off and prove that anyone with enough determination can drive startup growth in their region.
